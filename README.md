# Puzzle Solving Robot - eYRC - IIT Bombay - 2015

Welcome to the Puzzle Solving Robot competition repository! This competition challenges participants to design and program a robot that can autonomously solve a given puzzle. The competition aims to foster innovation in robotics, programming, and problem-solving skills.

## Problem Statement

The objective of the competition is to build a robot that can successfully solve a mathematical puzzle involving a variety of topics like Digital Image Processing, Motion Planning and Simple Arithmetic. The arena for this theme consists of two divisions â€“ The first is a grid with each Cell in the grid containing a block numbered with a digit from 0-9; the second is a grid with a maximum of four numbers in the range 0-20 placed arbitrarily in any Cells of the grid. The robot has to pick up the numbered blocks from the first division and place them over each number in the second division such that the sum of the numbers on the blocks is equal to the number on which the blocks are placed.
